# AIM: Using gene co-expression network to functionally analyse mRNA and miRNA expression trends in colon cancer progression 

 In this project the expression trends across the four stages of colon cancer are studied using correlation network (WGCNA) , Over representation and functional annotation clustering and finally gene-pathway network visualization using PANEV.
 
 The WGCNA-colon script is RMarkdown script (R version 3.10) containing the code and steps that were taken to answer the aim fo the study. The data used for this analysis is made avalaible in this  repository and was taken from Wen J, Hall B, Shi X, BMC Medical Genomics. 2019.
 Functional annotation and clustering was performed using the green module gene list.txt provided in the repository using medium stringency in DAVID 6.8.
 PANEV(Pathway Network Visualoization) was performed using code available in Palombo V, et al., PANEV: an R package for a pathway-based network visualization. BMC Bioinformatics. 2020.
 
 This project is part of the Network Biology Course for Masters in Systems Biology at Maastricht University, Netherlands.
